## [Full Report](./analysis.ipynb)

Telecom customers churn / retention analysis using Python. Answered several business questions regarding churned customer behavior.

## Project Goals

- Investigate customers' behavior of a telecom company.
- Take a closer look at churned customers' behavior before churn.
- Compare the churn rate per tenure group.
- Analyze retention rates of the customers for each service (voice call/internet).

## Summary

### Churn Analysis

1. The current churn rate is about 8%.
2. Churned users have dramatically less usage of both voice call and 2G/3G data.
3. Most churned users might have left because of poor 2G/3G service.
4. New customers are highly likely to stay with our service if the internet service works in that region.

### Cohort Analysis

1. The overall retention rate for voice call service is high (~85-95%).
2. Compared to voice call service, retention rates for internet service is much lower (~50-80%).
